# Smart Gallup Q12 survey

### The Gallup Q12 Index

Gallup's employee engagement work is based on more than 30 years of in-depth behavioral economic
research involving more than 17 million employees. Through rigorous research, Gallup has identified 12
core elements -- the Q12 -- that link powerfully to key business outcomes. These 12 statements
emerged as those that best predict employee and workgroup performance.
The Twelve Questions are:

1. Do you know what is expected of you at work?
2. Do you have the materials and equipment to do your work right?
3. At work, do you have the opportunity to do what you do best every day?
4. In the last seven days, have you received recognition or praise for doing good
work?
5. Does your supervisor, or someone at work, seem to care about you as a person?
6. Is there someone at work who encourages your development?
7. At work, do your opinions seem to count?
8. Does the mission/purpose of your company make you feel your job is important?
9. Are your associates (fellow employees) committed to doing quality work?
10. Do you have a best friend at work?
11. In the last six months, has someone at work talked to you about your progress?
12. In the last year, have you had opportunities to learn and grow?
